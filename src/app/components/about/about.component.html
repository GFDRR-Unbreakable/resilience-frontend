    Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $210 billion in 2016.”
    Such statements, while true, imply that the impact of disasters is limited
    to the damage inflicted on buildings, infrastructure, and agricultural production.
    However, $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person as it does to
    a poor person; the gravity of any loss depends on whom it affects, and the
    traditional focus on aggregate losses obscures the plight of poor people by
    restricting consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have
    considerable assets to lose in the first place.

    In 2016, the World Bank released Unbreakable, a flagship report that goes beyond
    traditional metrics like gross asset losses to examine how natural disasters
    affect people’s well-being. In an average year, the poorest 20% of people in a
    country suffer less than 10% of aggregate asset losses, but fully 25% of aggregate
    well-being losses. In other words, poor people suffer only a fraction of gross
    economic losses caused by disasters, but they bear a much larger brunt of disasters’
    consequences. This approach provides takes fuller account of how poverty increases
    people’s vulnerability to disasters, and disasters trap people in poverty.
